            <p>Impact Retreat is a 4-day retreat designed to connect incoming freshmen and transfer students to churches and ministries that will provide lasting community on the foundation of Jesus Christ and the Gospel. As someone who was so affected by this program, I could not resist returning as a counselor. In that position, I trained for a semester on listening, guiding, and facilitating conversations and put this into practice come to retreat with a group of freshmen. As a co-chair, I had the responsibilities of training eight counselors for our camp in preparation for retreat in the fall.</p>
            <p>Now as a member of our executive staff, I oversee selection, curriculum, training, and preparation for staff of 500+ in the student ministry. Also, I lead several weekly meetings with different groups of staff members and complete several logistical tasks in preparation for summer retreat.</p>

            <h3 class="light-color service-sub">Member</h3>
            <p>MSC FISH is a selective freshmen leadership organization focused on providing students leadership opportunities by engaging in community service and program development on campus and within the community. During my time in FISH, I participated in weekly service events such as playing bingo at a local community center and worked to plan one of our big events: Kyle Field Day- the largest freshmen-led service event held at Texas A&M that invites students and community members alike to "share their service."</p>
